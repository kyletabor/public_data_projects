# Prediction of Bike Sharing Usage

This is my first data science project. The goal is to predict the usage of the Washington DC bike sharing program. The analysis is based on a tutorial by [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io), but I have expanded the analysis into my own. The data was previously compiled and processed by Hadi Fanaee-T from the Univeristy of Porto and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
